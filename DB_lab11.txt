Step No. Terminal 1 							Step No. Terminal 2
1 Start a transaction and display the accounts information. 		2 Start a transaction and update the username for “Alice Jones” as “ajones”

BEGIN Transaction ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ;			Begin;
SELECT * FROM account;							Update account set username ='ajones' where username ='jones'
										
										
							
3 Display again the accounts table 					4 Display again the accounts table
SELECT * FROM account;							SELECT * FROM account;	
In 1st session, username is not updates, whereas for 2nd session we see new username 'ajones'
				
									5 Commit the changes and compare again both sessions.
SELECT * FROM account;							COMMIT;
									SELECT * FROM account;

Here both versions have updated username for Alice Jone (which is ajones)
									
									6 Start a new transaction
									Begin;
Here DBMS protection system is executed and it doesn't allow to make concurrent transactions. So we need to start again
 
7 Update the balance for the Alice’s account by +10.			8 Update the balance for the Alice’s account by +20
Begin;									Begin;
Update account SET balance=balance+10					Update account SET balance=balance+20
Where fullname='AliceJones';						Where fullname='AliceJones';
									ERROR:  current transaction is aborted, commands ignored until end of transaction block
									Here it also doesn't allow to make concurrent updates on the same columns

SELECT * FROM account;							
9 Commit the changes. 							10 Rollback

1   Begin								2   Begin
3   SELECT * from account						4   UPDATE account SET group_id=2 
									    Where username='bbrown';
5   SELECT * from account
//Here are no changes for terminal 1. 
//bob's group is still 3
//mike's balance = 73 before updating balance
  bob's balance = 100 before updating balance
6   UPDATE account SET balance=balance+15 
Where group_id=2;

After update, mike's balance = 88, bob's balance = 100. So no changes have been made for bob's balance!
